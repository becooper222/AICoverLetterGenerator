Using tools like Shoflo and adhering to AHL Rules and Procedures, I look forward to collaborating with the game operations staff to ensure each game is a memorable experience for fans.

Dear Mr. Doyle,

I am writing to express my interest in the Head Varsity Girls Ice Hockey Coach position at Hamden Hall Country Day School. With a rich background in athletic fundraising and a passion for team-building and mentorship, I am excited about the opportunity to lead and develop the school's inaugural girls' ice hockey team.

While my professional experience has largely been in roles focusing on sales, client relationships, and team management, my organizational skills and ability to build meaningful connections uniquely position me for this coaching role. My time at Gaucho Fund honed my ability to coordinate events and connect with a diverse range of stakeholders while achieving ambitious fundraising goals. I have translated these skills into effective team leadership and strategic planning skills, which are crucial for launching a first-year program.

As a Social Media Manager at Barstool Sports, I was tasked with creating and managing a new UCSB Barstool Instagram and Twitter account. This experience taught me the importance of nurturing a team culture and motivating my peers, which are foundational elements of any successful sports program. Successfully managing and expanding this team highlights my capability to lead and foster a dynamic and successful unit—skills directly transferable to coaching a varsity team.

In addition to my professional achievements, my academic pursuits, including a Certificate in Sports Management and a Minor in Spanish, reflect my commitment to the field of athletics and my ability to communicate effectively with diverse groups. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my organizational communication skills and strategic planning capabilities to inspire and develop the student-athletes at Hamden Hall Country Day School.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to the school's athletics department and make a positive impact on the girls’ ice hockey program.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Healthcare Data Analyst / Healthcare Data Engineer position at Wellth. With over three years of experience in healthcare data analysis and engineering, alongside a versatile skill set in Python, SQL, and AWS tools like dbt, I am equipped to contribute effectively to Wellth's mission of driving positive health outcomes through data-driven solutions.

In my current role at Boston Children’s Hospital, I have crafted insightful reports and visualizations that drive decision-making across departments, contributing significantly to hospital-wide initiatives such as the Medicaid program, which captured over $25 million for the institution. My technical acumen is complemented by my advanced studies in Data Science in Biomedicine from UCLA, where I am deepening my expertise in algorithm development and predictive modeling—skills that I believe align closely with Wellth’s objectives to propose target patient cohorts and demonstrate the ROI of your innovative platform.

At Cipher Skin, I authored algorithms to transform raw PPG data into actionable health metrics, reinforcing my proficiency in transforming customer formats into standard operational frameworks. Additionally, my hands-on experience with Jupyter and Redshift aligns with your requirements, and I am keen to leverage these tools to bolster Wellth's data infrastructure.

I am particularly attracted to the collaborative environment at Wellth, where I can contribute to customer acquisition and retention strategies while partnering with diverse teams. My background in supporting clinical pathways and analytics transitions attests to my ability to manage multiple responsibilities autonomously and collaboratively, ensuring seamless integration and successful client engagements. I look forward to the opportunity to partner with Wellth’s talented team to further your mission of empowering healthier behaviors.

Empassion is one of the most impactful and exciting start ups in health care. We are focused on improving the experience and lowering costs for seniors at end of life. Specifically, we provide palliative and hospice care for seniors with serious illness and high risk of an over-medicalized death. This population is highly neglected in the current market. Empassion clients are payers and risk-bearing entities and we work with community palliative and hospice partners to deliver superior outcomes. We are live today across 44 states and growing rapidly. Empassion is a hybrid remote/in-person company, with headquarters in NYC. We prioritize asynchronous work and communication but are quick to get on a call, Zoom, or even flight if the situation requires higher fidelity discussion. You will have the opportunity to spend time with colleagues in person, including an all-team offsite 1-2x per year (location varies). What your experience will be: The Data & Analytics team is a high-impact, high-visibility team that works cross-functionally with the entire organization. We are creating a robust, flexible, and modern analytics platform that is core to delivering the company’s technology and service capabilities. The Data Analyst will report directly to the Director of Data & Analytics. They will work alongside a team of experienced Analytics Engineers and Data Analysts to build out and maintain robust data pipelines and analytics solutions to better understand our patient population using a combination of SQL, dbt, and Looker. They will partner closely with our Growth, Product-Dev, Ops, and Finance teams to deliver explanatory and actionable insights as we work to improve the care our patients receive. Why you belong here and how you will grow: This is a remote opportunity to support the buildout of Empassion’s analytics platform and to be part of a passionate, skilled, and committed team working together to realize our shared vision. We pride ourselves on providing accurate, timely, and actionable data to our internal and external users. We hold ourselves to a high standard that respects the impact our data and analytics can have on a patient’s course of care. The Data & Analytics team is composed of specialists who can flex across different types of work as needed. The Data Analyst will be designing and building analytics models, reports, and dashboards to enable and empower Empassion and our customers to better understand their patients. We strive to build sustainable data products that our users can operate themselves day-to-day, but are highly responsive when the business has additional data needs and questions. We are a remote first company, fully distributed across the United States, with a hybrid in-person option for those based in NYC, meeting 2x per week. We prioritize our work activities weekly and hold ourselves accountable to deliverables. We use Slack as a team and have regular Zoom touch points. We have full team offsites 2x per year and additional travel as needed (both to improve work productivity and build team trust). We are dedicated to cultivating relationships built for trust and meaningful experiences that promote your growth. We recognize the value of autonomy, flexibility, and ownership while not losing sight of the importance of real-life experiences. We do not accept anything less than respectful, supportive, and growth-oriented teammates. What success looks like

Collaborate with cross-functional teams to understand business requirements and report on data from a variety sources, ensuring data quality, consistency, and accuracy
Calculate novel metrics from our proprietary application and third party platform’s data to understand how patients are moving through care programs and the quality of care they’re receiving from their providers
Design, develop, and maintain algorithms and data models, using SQL and dbt
Use Looker to create visually appealing and informative dashboards and reports to communicate data insights and enable data-driven decision-making by our stakeholders
Create documentation and training materials for technical and non-technical users of our data products
Work with your fellow data analysts and analytics engineers to co-author a coherent and intuitive data warehouse, providing feedback on approaches, code review, and a sense of shared ownership
Expect your 'building time' to be roughly evenly split between dbt, LookML, Looker dashboards, and SQL analysis
Travel up to 15% of the time to collaborate with others in NYC and Jacksonville, Florida


What you will bring

1 to 5 years of experience in data analytics or analytics engineering, having delivered actionable insights and compelling visualizations to Operations, Finance, or Clinical teams
Strong SQL skills
Excellent communication skills with both technical and non-technical audiences (peers, engineers, operations, external customers or prospects)
Excitement about working in a fast-moving startup environment
A bias for action and enthusiasm for fast iteration and creative problem solving
A desire to learn more about the operational workflows of our business and the healthcare delivery system as a whole


Nice to have

Familiarity with the basics of healthcare delivery and data sources/standards (Claims, ADT, etc.)
Experience working with Product-Dev teams to thoroughly understand data generated by internally-built applications
Experience with version control using git / github
Experience in dbt and looker
Experience in seed or series A startups","Benjamin Cooper

Dear Hiring Manager,  
  
I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the physical therapy position, where I can bring over three decades of dedicated experience in treating patients, as well as my passion for delivering high-quality care. My professional journey, which spans roles in outpatient clinics, home care, and rehabilitation services, has equipped me with diverse treatment approaches and a deep understanding of patient needs.  
  
With a career that began at renowned institutions like JFK Medical Center and evolved through leadership roles such as President at Cooper Rehabilitation and Sports Therapy, I have honed my skills in developing personalized treatment plans. At Cooper Rehabilitation, I successfully integrated cutting-edge therapeutic techniques, greatly enhancing patient outcomes and business growth. My commitment to excellence in rehabilitation therapy was further solidified through my tenure as a Home Care Therapist with several organizations, where I provided compassionate, one-on-one care.  
  
I am particularly drawn to opportunities that allow for a patient-centered approach, as evident in the collaborative and multidisciplinary settings I've thrived in. My role as a Clinical Consultant for Exerscience, Inc. enriched my ability to understand both the technical and educational aspects of physical therapy, making me adept at teaching patients about their own health journeys. Coupled with active membership and leadership in professional associations, such as the American Physical Therapy Association, I ensure that my practice is informed by the latest advancements and ethical standards.  
  
Joining your team would be a privilege, allowing me to contribute my broad expertise and a genuine passion for patient care. I am eager to bring my skills and dedication to the role, fostering a healing environment where patients feel supported and motivated.

My role as an Inside Sales Representative required exceptional communication skills, as I often initiated contact with potential clients, converting leads into valuable relationships. This experience taught me the importance of building rapport quickly, a skill that I believe is crucial for creating memorable first impressions with guests.

Additionally, my previous experience as an Athletic Fundraising Intern at GauchoFund provided me with insight into coordinating events and ensuring seamless guest experiences. Organizing hospitality events allowed me to engage directly with attendees, similar to the Front Desk Agent role's interaction with hotel guests. Furthermore, my fluency in Spanish will enable me to communicate effectively with a diverse range of guests, enhancing their overall stay by making them feel understood and welcomed.

I am particularly drawn to this position because it offers a unique opportunity to serve as an ambassador for not only the hotel but also the local area. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can collaborate with different departments to ensure that guest needs are anticipated and met with efficiency and warmth. I am excited about the prospect of being a part of a team that values top-tier guest service and strives to exceed expectations.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Customer Relations Associate position at IKEA. With a background in developing engaging experiences and ensuring a positive environment for diverse groups, I believe I am well-equipped to contribute to the IKEA team and reinforce the renowned customer-centric experience.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity at IKEA because of the company's commitment to creating joy-filled experiences through genuine customer interactions.

Headway’s mission is a big one – to build a new mental health care system everyone can access. We’ve built technology that helps people find great therapists with the first software-enabled national network of providers accepting insurance. 

1 in 4 people in the US have a treatable mental health condition, but the majority of providers don’t accept insurance, making therapy too expensive for most people. Headway is building a new mental healthcare system that everyone can access by making it easy for therapists to accept insurance and scale their practice. 

Headway was founded in 2019. Since then, we’ve grown into a diverse, national network of over 45,000 mental healthcare providers across all 50 states who run their practice on our software and have served over 1 million patients. We’re a Series D company with over $325m in funding from a16z (Andreessen Horowitz), Accel, GV (formerly Google Ventures), Spark Capital, Thrive Capital, Forerunner Ventures and Health Care Service Corporation.

We want your time here to be the most meaningful experience of your career. Join us, and help change mental healthcare for the better.

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Data Analyst position at Headway.

One of my core strengths lies in my ability to communicate intricate data narratives to diverse audiences, ensuring that technical insights are comprehensible and actionable. This skill, honed through years of experience and roles encompassing data scientist and research analyst, enables me to bridge the gap between data intricacies and operational strategy effectively. I am driven by the prospect of collaborating with Headway’s teams to model data innovatively, crafting impactful visualizations and strategic insights that will foster meaningful improvements in mental health care accessibility.

I am especially motivated by the opportunity to be an integral part of every aspect of data at Headway.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Analyst, US Sports Sponsorship position at American Express. With a strong background in partnership management, cross-functional collaboration, and communication, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team, particularly focusing on the exciting partnership with Formula 1.

My professional experience with Human Interest and ADP has honed my ability to manage complex partner networks and deliver impactful results. At Human Interest, I effectively managed over 40 partner accounts across various channels while at ADP, I developed and nurtured a network of 20+ referring partners nationwide, securing a significant portion of our business through these strategic relationships. These roles required me to balance multiple priorities, communicate effectively across various stakeholders, and drive strategic initiatives to successful execution—all skills that are essential to the Senior Analyst role at American Express.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the emphasis on collaboration and innovation. At ADP, I routinely worked with internal partners on deal negotiations and leveraged relationships for new business development, experiences that align closely with your requirement to partner across functional and agency teams. Additionally, my internship with the EPA required me to manage communications under tight deadlines, which has prepared me well for the fast-paced and dynamic environment at American Express.

Moreover, my leadership roles in university organizations have further equipped me with the skills necessary to contribute positively to team culture and take initiative in complex and large-scale event planning. This experience, coupled with my analytical skills, will enable me to navigate the sponsorship activation development and measurement processes effectively, ensuring that each partnership exceeds expectations.

I am enthusiastic about the possibility of joining American Express and contributing to the Global Sponsorships & Experiential Marketing team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can add value to your team.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the opportunity to join The Met as a part of your Membership Marketing team. With a strong background in strategic planning, outreach, and communication, I am well-prepared to help elevate The Met's Annual Fund Program and contribute to its mission of inspiring curiosity and creativity among a diverse and global audience. The chance to combine my passion for art with my professional experience in marketing makes this position particularly compelling.

In my recent role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I managed over 40 partner accounts across various channels, consistently driving product engagement and building strong relationships with stakeholders. My ability to deliver compelling messages and coordinate cross-functional projects translates seamlessly to The Met’s need for a creative fundraising professional capable of executing multichannel marketing efforts and developing cohesive strategic plans. My time at ADP further honed my skills in outreach and project management, where I successfully led all aspects of the sales process—from initial outreach through negotiation—resulting in significant business growth.

The Met's commitment to inclusivity, collaboration, and integrity aligns perfectly with my values and professional ethos. Having been involved in the non-profit sector as a Student Caller at Syracuse University Telefund, I secured numerous donations through strategic communication and engagement tactics. This experience gives me firsthand insight into the nuances of donor cultivation and stewardship, skills that are critical for the role at The Met. Additionally, my public affairs internship at the Environmental Protection Agency sharpened my analytical and organizational skills, essential for managing simultaneous campaigns and ensuring alignment with financial and strategic objectives.

The opportunity to collaborate with The Met's diverse internal teams and to engage with a global donor base excites me. My ability to navigate complex projects, combined with my strategic approach to marketing and outreach, make me an ideal candidate to drive growth in the Membership and Annual Fund initiatives. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to The Met’s mission of excellence and innovation.

I delivered research presentations to diverse audiences and created detailed media monitoring reports that informed policy decisions. These experiences have refined my ability to communicate complex information clearly and persuasively, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned and informed throughout each project.

Furthermore, my educational background, characterized by a BA in Political Science and a Minor in Environment & Society from Syracuse University, has provided me a solid foundation in analytical thinking and strategic problem-solving.

Why Clipboard Health Exists:
We exist to lift as many people up the socioeconomic ladder as possible. We dramatically improve lives, by letting healthcare professionals turn extra time and ambition into career growth and financial opportunity. We achieve this with our app-based marketplace that connects healthcare facilities and healthcare professionals, allowing healthcare professionals to book on-demand shifts and healthcare facilities to access on-demand talent. Our mission is to enable healthcare professionals to work when and where they want, and to enable healthcare facilities to meet their talent needs.

About Clipboard Health:
Clipboard Health is a post-Series C, extremely fast-growing tech startup with classic two-sided network effects, revolutionizing the market for healthcare talent. We are a diverse and inclusive company with a global, remote team. We’ve been featured on YC’s Top Companies and grown 20x+ since January 2021. There has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team and help us serve even more healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities, who can then better serve patients. To learn more about working at Clipboard Health, take a look at our Careers page and how we work.

About the role

Quality Analysts are the eyes and ears of the marketplace. They are responsible for surfacing unexpected or fraudulent behavior on the platform, using sound judgment to decide on an appropriate course of action, and clearly documenting their reasoning. Quality analysts are our “boots on the ground” for fostering a healthy marketplace, and their observations directly inform future product features and/or marketplace policies. 


Responsibilities include  

Investigating and passing judgment on dozens of cases of unexpected or fraudulent behavior per day. This is in a timely manner and with clearly documented reasoning. 
Managing communications with healthcare professionals and healthcare facilities in connection with those cases. 
Investigate behavior that seems “off” within the marketplace. Clearly communicate your findings for the rest of the team. 
Be the expert on marketplace policies for internal stakeholders.


You’re a good fit for this role if

You like to write, and you do it well. Clipboard has a strong written culture (see how we work) and almost all of our communication and decisions are made via writing. 
You can reason comfortably with incomplete information. Sometimes, we don’t have all the facts relevant to a decision. Great analysts are comfortable reaching a principled conclusion in the face of ambiguity. 
You have a “let’s do this” attitude. Clipboard Health is a startup. Problems will come up that don’t have straightforward solutions. You’re willing to get resourceful and solve them in the absence of an SOP or clear playbook. 
You’re naturally a little skeptical. Analysts handle a lot of conflicting information. Your job is to piece it together into something coherent and then take appropriate action.
You have attention to detail. As mentioned, we handle a lot of information. Noticing small details can be the difference between making a decision that helps or disappoints customers. 
To note
Clipboard is a data heavy culture. We’re excited about applicants that are comfortable with data and have experience with BI tools, SQL, python, excel, etc… That being said, data fluency is not a prerequisite for the role.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to submit my application for the Quality Analyst position at Clipboard Health. With a strong background in data science and extensive experience in analysis and quality improvement within healthcare environments, I am drawn to Clipboard Health's mission to empower healthcare professionals and facilities through innovation and efficiency. My skills in algorithm development, data fluency, and ability to communicate effectively through writing align closely with the responsibilities and requirements of this role.

In my current role as a Healthcare Data Analyst at Boston Children’s Hospital, I craft reports and visualizations that enable data-driven decision-making across departments. This experience has honed my attention to detail and ability to manage complex information, ensuring informed conclusions, even when faced with incomplete data. As someone who thrives in innovative settings, my work at Cipher Skin in developing algorithms and conducting experiments demonstrates my proactive approach and ""let's do this"" attitude, valuable traits for contributing to a fast-growing, dynamic company like Clipboard Health.

My startup experience has taught me the importance of adaptability and resourcefulness, particularly in roles without straightforward solutions. At Cipher Skin, I spearheaded product testing sessions and collaborated regularly with stakeholders, ensuring seamless communication and effective problem-solving—a foundational aspect of the Quality Analyst role. Additionally, my proficiency in Python, SQL, and BI dashboards further supports my capability to excel in Clipboard Health's data-heavy environment.

One of the aspects of Clipboard Health that excites me the most is its commitment to lifting individuals up the socioeconomic ladder. My work ethos aligns with this vision, and I am motivated by the opportunity to support healthcare professionals and facilities in optimizing their potential. I am eager to apply my data analysis expertise and writing proficiency to maintain a healthy marketplace and drive policy decisions that can have a significant impact.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the possibility of contributing to Clipboard Health's mission and being a part of a team that values innovation and quality. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my experience and skills can add value to your talented team.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Clinical Data Analyst position at Modern Health. With over four years of experience in healthcare analytics and a deep passion for improving mental health outcomes, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the innovative solutions Modern Health is delivering in the mental health space.

Throughout my career, I have honed my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and data visualization, with a particular focus on healthcare. At Boston Children’s Hospital, I crafted reports and visualizations that enabled data-driven decision-making across all departments and led initiatives that captured significant financial returns. My experience in health tech analytics aligns with Modern Health's mission to empower companies to provide holistic mental health solutions to their employees. My familiarity with SQL, Python, and data visualization tools such as Looker ensures that I can contribute effectively to Modern Health’s analytics needs.

My academic background, including a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering and a Master of Science in Data Science in Biomedicine, has provided me with a solid foundation in both the technical aspects of data science and the critical thinking skills needed to drive strategic projects. Additionally, my experience as a Data Scientist at Cipher Skin involved developing algorithms and leading experiments that directly contributed to product development in wearable health tech. This high-growth startup experience has equipped me with a bias toward action and a methodical approach to problem-solving, both of which are crucial in the fast-paced environment at Modern Health.

I am particularly drawn to the opportunity to collaborate cross-functionally at Modern Health, leveraging my ability to distill complex data into actionable insights and communicate these effectively with stakeholders at all levels. My work has consistently involved building relationships across departments to ensure data and analytics concepts are understood and applied to achieve business goals. I am eager to bring this expertise to Modern Health, working with the Clinical Strategy & Research, Product, and Go-To-Market teams to enhance member outcomes and share the value proposition of Modern Health's offerings.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to Modern Health's mission to destigmatize mental health and provide effective, accessible care through innovative data solutions.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Software Engineer position at Sketchy. With over three years of experience building responsive web applications and honed skills in TypeScript, React, CSS, and GitHub Actions, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to the innovative team at Sketchy.

In my current role as a Full Stack Software Engineer at Boston Children's Hospital's Office of Innovation, I have developed a strong foundation in responsive web application development using React and TypeScript. Collaborating with UX designers, I produce pixel-perfect applications that deliver exceptional user experiences, much like Sketchy's commitment to well-crafted software. My experience with RESTful APIs has also allowed me to design strategies that significantly enhance efficiency and accuracy, which aligns with your focus on engineering quality and launching functionalities that meet the needs of students and schools.

My background in Mechanical Engineering combined with my software engineering experience provides me with a unique problem-solving lens that I leverage in agile environments. At Boston Children's Hospital, I implemented a React component library to streamline future project development, a skill I am keen to bring to Sketchy to enhance your development processes. Additionally, my strategies for semi-automatic dependency updates and code security ensure high-quality and timely deliverables, reflecting Sketchy's commitment to engineering excellence.

I am particularly drawn to Sketchy's student-centered mission and the opportunity to collaborate with talented engineers, product designers, and product managers. I am eager to contribute my skills in writing clean, maintainable code and my understanding of non-functional requirements to support your production systems as part of the on-call rotation.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to Sketchy's innovative educational platforms and look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with your team's goals.

Sincerely,

My recent experiences as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest and as an Associate District Manager at ADP have honed my skills in developing relationships, conducting research, and managing complex projects—skills that align closely with the responsibilities outlined in the job description.

At the Environmental Protection Agency, I collaborated on research and presented findings related to the Onondaga Lake Superfund Site, reinforcing my analytical capabilities and understanding of government operations.

This role also deepened my commitment to working in sectors focused on societal impact, aligning with your firm’s values-driven approach to fostering equity and inclusion.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Climate Policy Analyst position at the New York State Department of Financial Services. With a strong academic background in Political Science and Environmental Studies, complemented by my professional experiences in managing partnerships and research-focused roles, I am well-prepared to contribute to the Department’s mission of ensuring a resilient financial system that meets the challenges posed by climate change.

In my previous role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I honed my skills in effectively communicating complex information to a diverse array of partners, a skill that is crucial for engaging DFS-regulated institutions in conversations about climate-related financial risks. My ability to manage over 40 partner accounts and lead networking initiatives to promote awareness aligns well with the duties of maintaining engagement and providing support for climate resiliency projects within the Department.

Furthermore, my internship with the Environmental Protection Agency equipped me with the analytical and research skills necessary for this role. By presenting detailed research reports and monitoring environmental trends, I gained invaluable experience in data analysis and policy development. This experience will enable me to assist in developing and implementing policy initiatives that address climate resiliency for New York State’s financial institutions.

My educational journey at Syracuse University allowed me to explore the intersection of political science and environmental issues, which has fueled my passion for sustainable finance and policy innovation. I am eager to collaborate with various divisions within the Department to support its climate-related financial supervision initiatives, as well as contribute to national and international discussions on climate resilience.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to bring my multidisciplinary expertise and passion for sustainable policy development to the New York State Department of Financial Services. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team’s efforts to protect consumers and drive economic growth through responsible innovation.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Project Manager position at NYCEDC, as advertised. I am particularly drawn to NYCEDC's mission of fostering inclusive innovation and economic growth across New York City, and I am eager to contribute to this vision by leveraging my expertise in strategic partnerships and communications.

In my previous role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I handled over 40 partner accounts, effectively communicating product updates and promotions to enhance relationships with stakeholders. My experience in managing partnerships also extends to my tenure at ADP, where I built and maintained a network of 20+ referring partners, securing over 75% of total business through these strategic alliances. These experiences have equipped me with the skills necessary to build and manage stakeholder relationships, paralleling NYCEDC's efforts to engage industry partners across various projects.

Furthermore, my position at the Environmental Protection Agency strengthened my analytical and communication skills through tasks such as presenting research reports to diverse audiences and creating media monitoring reports. These experiences honed my ability to convey transformative ideas persuasively and are directly applicable to the communication and public speaking skills required for the Project Manager role.

I am particularly enthused about the opportunity to support international stakeholder engagements and develop strategies that boost foreign direct investment in New York City. With my background in developing and executing engagement strategies, combined with a solid foundation in public affairs, I am confident in my ability to contribute to NYCEDC's goals of building strategic partnerships and fostering economic development.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to the success of NYCEDC and further its mission of creating a vibrant economy for all New Yorkers.

Whether mentoring young campers or assisting clients at the food pantry, I remain committed to delivering exceptional service and fostering a welcoming atmosphere for everyone. I am excited about the prospect of bringing this dedication to Panera Bread and contributing to your team’s success. 

Thank you for considering my application. I am looking forward to the opportunity to further discuss how I can contribute to the excellent service and community atmosphere at Panera Bread.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am excited to apply for the Customer Support & Training Specialist position at Raptor Maps. With over two years of experience in customer-facing roles, and a strong focus on project management, problem-solving, and teamwork, I am well-prepared to contribute effectively to your Operations Team and help drive Raptor Maps' mission of scaling the solar industry.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Marketing Associate position at Canoe Intelligence. With my robust background in marketing and public relations, combined with my experience in event management and keen eye for content development, I am well-prepared to contribute to the dynamic marketing team at Canoe and support its growth initiatives.

In my recent role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I managed over 40 partner accounts, showcasing my strong organizational skills and ability to effectively communicate product updates and promotions. My role required me to be a resourceful team player, adept at networking and building lasting relationships – skills that align perfectly with Canoe’s values of client-centric and ownership-driven excellence. At ADP, I led sales initiatives that exceeded expectations, reflecting my proactive nature and dedication to achieving positive outcomes.

My internship at the Environmental Protection Agency honed my skills in research and content creation. I delivered media monitoring reports and presentations to various stakeholders, which strengthened my communication abilities, especially in writing and editing. I am confident in my capacity to manage digital communications, from drafting engaging social media content to supporting comprehensive email campaigns as stated in your job description. Furthermore, my involvement in event organization throughout my academic and professional journey has equipped me with the experience necessary to manage Canoe-hosted events effectively.

I am particularly drawn to Canoe’s innovative approach to data processes in the financial tech sector, having acquired foundational finance and tech knowledge during my undergraduate studies and professional experiences. Collaborating with diverse teams and utilizing cutting-edge tools such as HubSpot and Canva excites me, as I am eager to expand Canoe’s brand presence and market penetration through creative strategies and meticulous planning.

Thank you for considering my application. I am enthusiastic about the prospect of contributing to Canoe Intelligence’s marketing efforts and am eager to bring my skills in client communication, content development, and event management to your esteemed team.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Client Support Associate position at River as advertised. With a background in managing client and partner relationships in customer-centric roles, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team’s mission to provide premier Bitcoin banking solutions. My experience aligns well with the qualities and skills River values, such as clear communication, effective collaboration, and adaptability.

In my previous role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I managed over 40 partner accounts across diverse channels, delivering exceptional service and facilitating seamless communication of product updates. This required a high level of critical thinking and adaptability, skills that I honed by analyzing partner feedback to enhance service offerings. Furthermore, my tenure at ADP as an Associate District Manager involved building a robust network of referring partners, accounting for significant business growth through strategic relationship management and negotiation.

I am particularly drawn to this opportunity at River because it offers an environment where strategic thinking and effective communication are paramount. My role as a Public Affairs Intern at the Environmental Protection Agency equipped me with the experience of translating complex data into actionable insights, an ability that will be valuable when analyzing trends in client activity and supporting product enhancement based on client feedback.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my interest in the Customer Support Representative position at Greenspark. With a comprehensive background in customer-facing roles, a passion for sustainability, and a proven track record in effectively managing partnerships and addressing client needs, I am eager to contribute to the exceptional customer experience your innovative company is known for.

My previous experience as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest and an Associate District Manager at ADP has honed my skills in communication, client advocacy, and analytical problem-solving.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Analyst position at The Miles Group. With a solid foundation in business development, account management, and analytical research, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your world-class talent strategies aimed at maximizing corporate leadership potential. My experience aligns well with your requirements, and I am eager to bring my skills in client work and project management to your esteemed company.  

During my tenure as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I successfully managed over 40 diverse partner accounts, leveraging key relationships to effectively communicate product updates and promotions. My role required the crafting of compelling presentations to potential partners and participation in high-stakes networking events, enhancing my ability to create business development materials and communicate insights with clarity and precision. This experience honed my capability to convey complex information through visually compelling slides, a skill that I understand is crucial for the development of client deliverables similar to those at The Miles Group.  

In my previous role with ADP, I demonstrated strong critical thinking and project management skills by managing a network of over 20 referring partners and exceeding sales benchmarks by 120% of the plan for FY23. This achievement was the result of meticulous attention to detail and the ability to analyze and synthesize large volumes of information, ensuring that outreach, presentation, and negotiation phases were handled with precision. Such skills are directly applicable to supporting TMG’s client engagements and identifying opportunities for process improvements within the firm.  

My academic background in Political Science, combined with a minor in Environment & Society, has provided me with a robust foundation for research and data analysis, which was evident in my internship with the Environmental Protection Agency. Preparing research reports and media monitoring guided by credible sources bolstered my proficiency in generating focused insights pertinent to organizational success. I am eager to apply this experience to support client engagements at TMG, further contributing to valuable talent strategies aimed at industry leaders.  

I am enthusiastic about the potential to engage in special projects and enhance the assets and capabilities of The Miles Group. With my strong organizational and interpersonal skills, I am confident in my ability to thrive in a fast-paced environment while managing multiple tasks simultaneously. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of contributing to your team.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Operations & Expansion Associate position at Via. Your mission to transform global transportation resonates deeply with my professional background and personal interests, particularly in leveraging technology for sustainable development.

I am excited about the prospect of joining Via and being part of a team that is at the forefront of transforming global transportation. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to further discuss how my skills and experiences can contribute to Via's continued success.

Operations","critical thinking, data driven, attention to detail","NRG is a leading global insights and strategy firm at the confluence of content, culture, and technology. We stay ahead of what ’ s next, providing fresh insights to spark new ideas. We ’ re a trusted partner to our clients, working behind the scenes to bring imagination, depth, and clarity to their biggest challenges — in entertainment, technology, lifestyle, sports, and gaming. Together, we create with confidence.

We’re proud of our company’s values – these values guide us as we navigate sunny days, gray skies and everything in between:

  Do what you love. With conviction. 
 Where discovery lives. And impact drives. 
 Celebrate difference. Cultivate belonging. 
 Big thinking. Collectively inspired. 
 Embrace the journey. Be human. 


 The Opportunity 

We are seeking a passionate and inquisitive Analyst or Sr. Analyst to join our Client Services team. Our Client Services team is made up of world class researchers who bring unmatched industry expertise, a global perspective, and passion for all consumers in the rapidly evolving entertainment, technology, gaming, sports and lifestyle landscapes. This team works on research initiatives that help answer the most important strategic business questions for some of the world’s biggest brands! They help our clients leverage consumer insights to challenge conventional thinking, uncover new ideas, build better experiences, and continue to grow and innovate. Their rigorous research and expert consulting guide our clients to create their next story, product or strategy.

In this role, you will support a wide range of initiatives across the full project lifecycle from proposal to report delivery. If you’re passionate about qualitative and quantitative research; if you enjoy visualizing data and discovering insights with confidence; and are looking for a great opportunity to start your career where you can make an impact, this opportunity is for you!

 Your Impact 

  Support all phases of quantitative and qualitative research projects, including research design, questionnaire and discussion guide development, data analysis and storytelling.
 Projects may include methods such as concept evaluation, brand studies, content optimization tests, messaging/positioning evaluation, creative materials tests, market sizing and segmentation. 
 Help drive quality control processes at each step of the research lifecycle, from checking survey programming logic, questionnaire proofing, number checking and proofing reports and presentations for accuracy. 
 Partner with internal and external operations teams (programming, fieldwork, facilities, moderators, data processing) to drive projects forward on stringent timelines. 
 Assist with translating data into clear, actionable insights and recommendations through visual, creative and story-driven reports. 

Who We're Looking For

 Must haves: 

  Curiosity and Critical Thinking– You are genuinely interested in seeking information on the “whys,” always digging for more information to understand what makes consumers tick. Whether it’s understanding why one marketing message is more effective than another or what consumers think we could be using AI for in the future, you can always find something interesting to sink your teeth into. Simply put, you love to learn. 
 Problem Solver– You are a natural problem solver. When something doesn’t go as planned, your first instinct is to look for a solution, rather than viewing it as a roadblock. You’re always on the lookout for new ways to accomplish tasks and have the ability to address issues using creative and collaborative tactics. 
 Data Driven– You’re comfortable working with data to identify trends and insights, including both structured (i.e. data and hard numbers) and unstructured (i.e. interviews and qualitative) data. Experience visualizing data with tools such as Excel, PowerPoint, Google Docs and Slides is preferred. 
 Self-starter – Internally-motivated who continuously strives to get things done well, regardless of challenges encountered. You are proactive and always keep an eye on the next step. 
 Clear and Proactive Communicator– You have excellent written and verbal communication skills and are able to communicate clearly and succinctly. You’re comfortable asking questions and sharing your point of view. 
 Hawk-eyed attention to detail – You notice when font sizes change unexpectedly or a proper noun isn’t capitalized. Errors don’t get past you and you are always focused on ensuring high levels of quality control and reporting. 
 Expert multitasker – Successfully manages time and multiple competing priorities to ensure deadlines are always met. Staying organized is a must for managing projects! 
 Great Team Member – T eam player who works collaboratively and harmoniously within a team and across teams. You are comfortable forming connections with colleagues remotely whether that be jumping on a quick video meeting, picking up the phone for a call or chatting with them through IMs. You welcome feedback because you have a zest for learning and growing. You will roll up your sleeves to help get the job done and no task is beneath you. 
 Your degree(s) – You have a B.A./B.S. degree in areas such as Social Sciences, Psychology, Business, Marketing, Market Research, Statistics, Economics or a r elated field. Additional degrees are welcome! 


 Bonus attributes (nice-to-haves but not required): 

  Passion – A passion or desire to learn about technology, entertainment, sports and/or lifestyle sectors. You enjoy or are excited by the prospect of staying up to date on industry trends and developments. 
 Prior Experience – Prior internship or work experience in market research or consumer insights is a plus. If you don’t have relevant work experience, we would love to hear about academic qualitative or quantitative research projects, such as primary survey research, experimental psychology studies, social media analysis, ethnographic research, or any other relevant projects. 
 Data analysis techniques and software– Familiarity with any of the following data analysis techniques would be awesome: statistical significance testing, correlation analysis, multivariate analysis techniques (such as cluster/segmentation analysis) and conjoint and discrete choice analysis. Experience with statistical packages, like SPSS or Q, are a plus. 


 Position Type 

This is a full-time, exempt position.

What We Offer

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiasm for the Integrated Marketing Manager position at BLADE. With a robust background in integrated and digital marketing combined with proven analytical skills and a strong professional demeanor, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to BLADE’s mission of delivering exceptional customer experiences through innovative and personalized marketing strategies.

In my recent role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I successfully managed over 40 partner accounts, demonstrating my ability to develop and execute effective communication strategies across various channels. My experience at ADP as an Associate District Manager further honed my skills in relationship-building and strategic planning, as I achieved 120% of my sales plan by leveraging partnerships and crafting targeted outreach efforts. These roles have equipped me with the expertise to oversee the strategy, execution, and performance of multi-channel campaigns, aligning perfectly with the responsibilities you outlined.

I have extensive hands-on experience with data-driven marketing platforms, including leveraging CRM tools and segmentation techniques to optimize campaigns for increased engagement and retention. My proficiency with tools like Braze and my analytical approach with platforms such as Google Analytics enable me to not only build and optimize omnichannel marketing campaigns but also generate meaningful insights to drive business growth. My solid foundation in using metrics to enhance marketing performance is well-aligned with the performance analysis and optimization aspect of this role.

Beyond technical skills, I bring a collaborative spirit and professional acumen reflected in my participation in cross-functional initiatives at the Environmental Protection Agency, where I presented comprehensive research reports and supported strategic communication efforts. This ability to work independently and as part of a team underpins my capacity to deliver high-quality work under tight timelines, a quality that I understand is crucial to the culture at BLADE.

I am eager to bring my passion for marketing and my commitment to driving results to BLADE as an Integrated Marketing Manager. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how I can contribute to your team.

Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Analyst, Digital Sports Inventory position at NBCUniversal. With a robust background in account management and a proven track record of building and maintaining strategic partnerships, I am eager to leverage these skills in contributing to the innovative Ad Sales team at NBC Sports. My experience in fast-paced sales environments, combined with my analytical problem-solving abilities, align well with the requirements of this role.

At ADP, I honed my skills in managing a network of over 20 referring partners, which resulted in securing more than 75% of total business through strategic customer acquisition and retention. My responsibilities there, including deal negotiation and closing, taught me the importance of data-driven decision-making in optimizing sales strategies. These experiences have given me a strong foundation in understanding user patterns and effectively communicating inventory availabilities as would be needed at NBCUniversal.

In my recent role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I successfully managed over 40 partner accounts, driving growth by communicating product updates and engaging in meaningful client interactions. My proactive approach and responsive communications aided product promotions and increased brand awareness. This experience, combined with my proficiency in analyzing quantitative and qualitative data, positions me well to excel in forecasting and allocating digital media inventory across NBC Sports' vast portfolio. 

I am particularly drawn to NBCUniversal's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion and am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a workplace that values these principles as much as I do. NBCUniversal’s reputation for producing world-class content aligns with my career aspirations and passion for strategic planning and the sports industry. Moreover, my strong verbal and written communication skills will be pivotal in effectively liaising with multiple departments and driving cross-functional collaboration.

I am enthusiastic about the prospect of bringing my expertise in sales, analysis, and collaborative problem-solving to the NBCU team. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and enthusiasms align with the goals of NBCUniversal.

I am writing to express my interest in the Strategy & Planning Analyst position at Too Good To Go. With a background in strategic account management and data-driven analysis, combined with a strong passion for sustainability initiatives, I am eager to contribute to your mission to combat food waste and create a positive social impact.

My experience as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest has honed my abilities in managing high-stakes projects and building strong relationships across diverse channels, including payroll, financial advisors, and benefit brokers.

These experiences have cultivated a proactive, solution-oriented mindset, aligning with your values of winning together and raising the bar.

The environmental initiatives at Too Good To Go resonate with my academic background—having graduated with a BA in Political Science and a minor in Environment & Society from Syracuse University. During my internship with the Environmental Protection Agency, I presented research on vital environmental sites and crafted media monitoring reports, sharpening my skills in data retrieval and analytical reporting. This foundation is crucial for monitoring marketplace health and driving growth strategies in your scale-up environment.

Beyond technical skills, my interpersonal and communication strengths are evidenced by my success in securing over 100 contributions as a Student Caller at Syracuse University and organizing large-scale events in leadership roles. I am eager to bring this ability to build and maintain relationships to your global team, ensuring effective collaboration with local and international stakeholders.

Thank you for considering my application. I am excited about the opportunity to join an innovative and influential company like Too Good To Go and to contribute meaningfully to your mission. I look forward to potentially discussing how I can add value to your strategy and planning endeavors.

Dear Hiring Manager,  

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Account Coordinator position with BerlinRosen's Cities & Public Affairs Team. With a background in public affairs, strategic communications, and a deep dedication to urban planning and social issues, I am eager to contribute to your team and help shape the future of cities across the country. BerlinRosen’s commitment to impactful communication, coupled with its dedication to diverse and inclusive practices, aligns perfectly with my professional goals and personal values.

During my time as a Public Affairs Intern at the Environmental Protection Agency, I honed my skills in media monitoring and communications strategy while working on significant projects like the Onondaga Lake Superfund Site. This experience fortified my understanding of complex environmental and urban issues and equipped me with the ability to compose compelling narratives and detailed reports. My role also involved daily creation of media monitoring reports, a task that sharpened my attention to detail and organizational skills—both crucial for success in a fast-paced environment like BerlinRosen.

In my most recent role as a Partner Account Manager at Human Interest, I managed over 40 partner accounts, where I demonstrated my ability to communicate clearly and effectively with diverse stakeholders. My experience in account management taught me the value of precision and clarity in communication, essential traits for managing multiple assignments and meeting tight deadlines. These skills will be directly applicable in your workspace, where strategic, creative thinking, and multitasking are essential to advancing client goals.

I am particularly excited about the opportunity to work on public affairs initiatives that advance social impact and progressive policy. My academic background in Political Science, coupled with my practical experience in advocacy and strategic communications, has prepared me to make a significant contribution to BerlinRosen.
